In this repo you can find the challenges I wrote for m0leCon Teaser 2023.

Challenges are supposed to be solved white-box, as players had access to all the source files.

## Print Template [web] (1 solve)

Kudos to [organizers](https://org.anize.rs/) for being the only team that solved this challenge during the competition!

After running `docker compose up` you can access the application at http://print.localtest.me:3000/ (I used a random domain that points to localhost to make things work between the main application and the SSO).


## Print Template 2 [web, crypto] (2 solves)

For this challenge I need to thank my teammate @mr96 for exploiting the crypto part of the challenge :)

Kudos to [organizers](https://org.anize.rs/) (again) and [kalmarunionen](https://www.kalmarunionen.dk/) for solving this challenge during the competition.

After running `docker compose up` you can access the application at http://localhost:3000/
